## What Is Civilization (CIV)?

CIV aims at building the world‚Äôs first Dex Fund: transforming the way how staking and investment are done, with 100% auditable code and, eventually, automated multi-strategy selection for maximum yield at minimum risk.

The new idea of a Dex Fund is to be based on community and code. Different from the traditional fiat-money fund, typically based around a trusted, well-known team with secret / proprietary ideas, personal network, access to money and hierarchical organization.

Quite on the contrary, in a Dex Fund: community drives decision-making, software code drives investment, and overall the system is trust-less, not driven by famous people‚Äôs CV but by a set of performance-driven principles.

The CIV project token can be used as:

* Enabler of investment on the CIV platform
* Store of value, with investment returns paid in CIV
* Hedge against volatility, with 1:1 ETH-CIV staking.

## How Many CIV Coins Are There in Circulation?

CIV launched on July 31, 2021 with exactly 300 million tokens created at genesis. The token is non-mintable, with audited contract. The entire 100% initial token supply has been committed to a Uniswap v2 liquidity pair, and the deployer‚Äôs liquidity token has been burnt to avoid any risks of hacking or rug pulls.

### Who Are the Founders of Civilization?

We aim at being the world's fully DEX Fund, meaning anonymous and software code based. Inspired by the great experiment of Ryoshi and the Shiba family, we launched exactly 1 year after Shiba Inu: no  external backers nor famous investors, by choice.

### Where Can I Buy the Civilization token (CIV)?

CIV is available for trading exclusively on the Ethereum network, initially on Uniswap v2 and thereafter on a growing number of exchanges.
